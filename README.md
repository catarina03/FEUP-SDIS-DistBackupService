## Distributed Backup Service  

In this project we developed a distributed backup service for a local area network (LAN).  
The idea was to use the free disk space of the computers in a LAN for backing up files in other computers in the same LAN.   
The service is provided by servers in an environment that is assumed cooperative (rather than hostile). Nevertheless, each server retains control over its own disks and, if needed, may reclaim the space it made available for backing up other computers' files.   
**Final grade:** 78%
